# React homework template

This project was created with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To get
acquainted and configure additional features
[refer to documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Contact Book

Add to the Contact Book application the ability to register, login, and user
updates, and work with a private collection of contacts.

### Backend

There is a ready-made backend for this task. Check out the documentation. It
supports all necessary operations on the contact collection, as well as
registering, logging in and user update with JWT. Use it instead of your backend
created with the service mockapi.io.

### Routing

Add routing with the React Router library. The application should have several
pages:

<ul>
<li>/register - public route to register a new user with a form</li>
<li>/login - public login route of an existing user with a form</li>
<li>/contacts - a private route for your contact list</li>
</ul>
Add a navigation component Navigation with links to navigate routes.

### User menu

Create a component UserMenu, that displays the user's email and a logout button.

### Styling

This is the final version of the application, so work on styling the interface.
You can use a styling library or components such as Chakra UI or Material UI.
